How to install Ruby on Rails with RVM on Debian 9
=================================================

Introduction
------------

Ruby on Rails is one of the most popular application stacks for developers looking to create sites and web apps. The Ruby programming language, combined with the Rails development framework, makes app development simple.

You can easily install Ruby and Rails with RVM, the Ruby Version Manager. RVM also lets you manage and work with multiple Ruby environments.

In this guide, you'll install RVM on a Debian 9 server, and then use RVM to install a stable version of Ruby on Rails. Once things are working, you'll learn how to manage multiple versions of Ruby with RVM.

## Prerequisites ##

To follow this tutorial, you need:

  * A Debian 9 server with a non-root user with `sudo` privileges. You can set up a user with these privileges in our [Initial Server Setup with Debian 9 guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-debian-8).

  * Node.js installed on your server, as Ruby on Rails uses Node.js to manage client-side assets. Follow [How To Install Node.js on Debian 9](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-debian-8).
