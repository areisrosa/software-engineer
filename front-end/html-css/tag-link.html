<!-- While <style> is convenient, the better practice is to put the CSS into a -->
<!--   separate file. One of the key advantages of using a separate file is that the -->
<!--   CSS styles can easily be re&#45;used between your different .html pages.  Many -->
<!--   authors further divide their CSS up into different files (for example: one -->
<!--     for text styles and another one for layout).   -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Simply put your CSS into a separate file. This file does not need any HTML -->
<!-- markup (i.e., no <style> tag required).  Use the .css file extension and use a -->
<!-- <link> tag to bind it in. The <link> tag must appear in the <head> section.  By -->
<!-- convention, css files are kept in a directory named css. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Use this <link> as a template: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Style and link tags</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/my_styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
