<!-- To place CSS directly into an HTML document, we use the <style> tag.  This tag -->
<!--     can appear anywhere in an HTML document, however, the most common practice -->
<!--     is to place it in the <head> section.  Such as:  -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Style and link tags</title>
        <style>
            /* CSS will go in this area */
        </style>
    </head>

    <body>
    </body>
</html>
